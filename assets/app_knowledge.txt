Tempus Victa — App Knowledge (Local-First)

What this is
- Tempus Victa is a local-first assistant that reduces entropy by ingesting signals and turning them into actions.
- AI is optional (opt-in and sticky). If AI is off, the app still works.

Core doctrine
- Everything is ingested as a Signal first.
- Everything is timestamped (captured/created/modified in UTC).
- Ready Room routes requests through: Local → Trusted Sources Cache → Web → AI (if enabled).

Modules
- Bridge: calm home + quick launch + daily brief.
- Signal Bay: triage of incoming signals (notifications, shares, voice/text captures).
- Corkboard: ideation space (post-its) that can convert into structured objects.
- Actions: your task list (Inbox/open/done).
- Projects: higher-level containers.
- Recycle: recover deleted items.
- Ready Room: command + query router (not a chatbot).

Global capture
- The mic button (bottom-right) opens Capture.
- Anything you type or say becomes:
  1) an Inbox Signal, and
  2) an Inbox Task (so nothing is lost)

Voice
- Tap mic to start listening.
- Tap again to stop; the transcript is saved immediately.

AI settings
- AI toggle is OFF by default.
- When enabled, AI stays enabled until you turn it off.
- OpenAI API Key is stored locally in your on-device database.

Web research
- Web research is only used after Local and Trusted Sources Cache are checked.
- Links returned are clickable.

Offline
- Offline: Local search and trusted cache still work.
- Web/AI gracefully report that the internet is unavailable.
