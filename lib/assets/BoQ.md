# MiKernael Book of Quotes (BoQ)
This book lives and grows:  C:\Projects\BoQ.md

The Book of Quotes is a **cognitive lever**, not inspiration porn.

Its purpose is to:
- Create double-takes
- Break mental loops
- Reframe decisions at inflection points

---

## Usage Rules
- Quotes are deployed **sparingly**
- Never stacked
- Never motivational fluff
- If it sounds like a poster, it doesn’t belong here
- Invoked by high confidence of being relevant, albeit sparingly, or by user invocation
- Additions added by prompt such as write that down, quote board, Book of Quotes, Quote it, or similar
- Additions are added under Canonical Quotes and formatted like this:
{
<Quote_Format>
### <Quote>
**Use when:**
<usage>
</Quote_Format>
}
