TEMPUS VICTA — READY ROOM
Full Functional Description (Pre-Refactor State)
This document describes in explicit detail the Ready Room module as it existed conceptually and functionally before UI destabilization. This is intended for reconstruction in a new session without architectural loss.
________________________________________
1. CORE PHILOSOPHY
Ready Room is NOT just a chat window.
It is:
•	The command interface to the entire application
•	The intelligence routing layer
•	The human-to-system translation engine
•	The feature discovery interface
•	The automation gateway
It operates under strict doctrine:
Local → Trusted Sources → Web → AI (if enabled)
It does NOT skip local.
It does NOT default to AI.
AI is opt-in and cost-aware.
The system is designed so that:
The better it works, the less the user has to use it.
________________________________________
2. VISUAL & STRUCTURAL DESIGN
Screen Layout
•	Title: Ready Room
•	AppBar actions:
o	Bridge button (always present)
o	Protocol button (Ready Room Protocol only)
o	Clock Tower button
•	No floating navigation buttons
•	No raw JSON ever visible
Message Layout
•	User messages right-aligned
•	Local/Web/AI/System left-aligned
•	Timestamped messages
•	Clean bubble styling
•	Names bolded without markdown symbols (no Obama: artifacts)
•	Persona color coding (Ready Room Protocol mode)
Input Bar
Single unified input box serves:
•	Local commands
•	Web research
•	AI queries (if enabled)
•	Task creation
•	Quote capture
•	Corkboard capture
•	Calendar questions
•	App help questions
AI toggle state is persistent.
Web toggle state is persistent.
AI button replaces send arrow when enabled.
If disabled, standard send arrow remains.
No accidental API burn.
________________________________________
3. PIPELINE LOGIC
Every query follows this routing unless AI bypass is explicitly used:
1.	LOCAL RESOLUTION
o	Calendar
o	Tasks
o	Projects
o	Corkboard
o	Quote Board
o	Signals
o	App Knowledge (How-To system)
o	User profile
If resolved locally → return structured answer.
2.	TRUSTED SOURCES CACHE
o	Domain-weighted
o	Wikipedia, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.
o	Re-ranked before display
o	No search engine branding shown
o	Links clickable
o	Click reinforces trust weight
3.	GENERAL WEB SEARCH
o	Clean summarized result
o	No "DuckDuckGo" or raw engine labeling
o	At least one meaningful snippet returned
4.	AI (ONLY IF ENABLED)
o	Uses OpenAI API key
o	Graceful error handling
o	Handles 429 rate limiting cleanly
o	Short but correct answers by default
o	Expandable upon request
________________________________________
4. READY ROOM PROTOCOL (THE FEATURE YOU LOVED)
Ready Room Protocol is a distinct mode.
It is NOT automatic.
It must be invoked explicitly.
Invocation options:
•	Protocol button
•	Confirmation prompt: "Invoke Ready Room Protocol?"
Protocol flow:
PHASE 1 — Parameter Collection
•	Moderator
•	Members
•	Format
•	Sentences per member
•	Purpose
•	Rules
•	Tone
•	Voting
•	Termination
•	Topic
Defaults applied only when user says "Defaults".
Members and Topic must be user-supplied.
PHASE 2 — Confirmation
System restates parameters.
User confirms.
PHASE 3 — Invocation
Visual:
•	Screen fades black
•	Matrix digital rain
•	Fast type-out of parameters
•	Green text
•	Persona color-coded responses
•	Bolded speaker names
Conversation then proceeds per format rules.
Upon termination:
•	Matrix rain outro
•	Return to normal Ready Room mode
This module is considered a "free preview" feature that could later become standalone.
________________________________________
5. USER LEARNING SYSTEM
Behavioral Telemetry
•	Attention time
•	Interaction frequency
•	Click patterns
•	Response expansions
Lexicon Layer
Tracks:
•	Phrase frequency
•	Intent bias
•	Humor markers
•	Action verbs
Example:
"You can quote me on that" → quote bias weight increases
Sender Weighting
Texts/emails weighted numerically.
High trust:
•	Jen
•	Dylan
•	Liam
•	Adam Schneider
Spam/"Scam" → very low weight.
System must learn automatically.
User should NOT have to manually assign weights.
________________________________________
6. AUTOMATION VISION
Future behaviors:
Example:
Jen texts:
"I need milk, eggs, bread, and magnum condoms from Kroger."
System should:
•	Parse grocery items
•	Add to grocery list
•	Create task
•	Find nearest Kroger
•	Suggest route
•	Update dynamically as more items arrive
Assistant model:
An Assistant that Optimizes my life through Automation
________________________________________
7. SIGNAL BAY (RENAMED FROM SIGNALS)
Signals are not noise.
Signals are actionable intelligence.
Informational-only events can be ignored.
Examples:
•	Alarm dismissed
•	Facebook notification
Actionable examples:
•	Confirm appointment
•	Charging error
•	High-trust sender request
Must allow manual override for importance.
Override remembered.
________________________________________
8. CORKBOARD
Not card-based list.
Realistic corkboard.
•	Free placement
•	Overlapping
•	Draggable
•	Post-it style
•	3D shadow
Still:
•	Timestamped
•	Clickable
•	Convertible to task/project
________________________________________
9. QUOTE BOARD
Capture methods:
•	Voice
•	Highlight
•	Phrase detection
•	Manual entry
Lightweight and fun.
________________________________________
10. DAILY BRIEF
Morning pop-up.
Adaptive timing.
Shows:
•	Today’s events
•	Leftovers
•	Completed
•	Added items
•	Tomorrow preview
•	Birthdays/holidays
Actions from brief:
•	Complete
•	Snooze
•	Push
•	Add to calendar
•	Send email
•	Remind user
________________________________________
11. SELF-AWARE HELP SYSTEM
Ready Room must answer:
•	"How do I add an API key?"
•	"What is the Ready Room?"
•	"How does Signal Bay work?"
It must NEVER reveal:
•	Code
•	Prompt structure
•	Schema
•	Proprietary logic
It is instructional, not exploitable.
________________________________________
12. TRUSTED SOURCES CACHE DESIGN
Purpose:
Entropy reduction.
Not storage.
Cap:
•	Active: 1 MB
•	Quarantine: 5 MB
Weighted by:
•	Base trust
•	Reinforcement
•	Recency
•	Usage count
Auto-prune low-trust stale domains.
________________________________________
13. WHAT YOU LOVED MOST
•	The Ready Room Protocol experience
•	Persona formatting
•	Structured flow
•	Clean pipeline
•	AI not forced
•	No raw engine branding
•	The idea that the app learns silently
•	Automation over micromanagement
________________________________________
END STATE GOAL
Tempus Victa is not a chatbot.
It is:
A local-first intelligence system
That automates your life
Learns from behavior
Weights trust
Reduces entropy
And requires less interaction over time.
________________________________________
End of Ready Room Functional Description.


TEMPUS VICTA — FULL LEARNING LOGIC SPECIFICATION
This document describes the COMPLETE intended learning architecture of Tempus Victa.
It explains the system from high-level philosophy down to grammar-level parsing logic.
This is designed for handoff into a fresh session without loss of architectural intent.
________________________________________
1. CORE PRINCIPLE
Tempus Victa is not an AI chatbot.
It is a local-first intelligence system that:
• Learns from behavior
• Weights trust
• Reduces entropy
• Automates selectively
• Avoids unnecessary API usage
• Preserves user control
Learning must be:
Passive first.
Corrective when necessary.
Never intrusive.
Never nagging.
The system learns through:
Observation → Weighting → Reinforcement → Decay → Adaptation
________________________________________
2. LEARNING LAYERS (TOP DOWN)
Tempus learning is multi-layered.
Layer 1 — Behavioral Telemetry
Layer 2 — Lexicon Engine
Layer 3 — Trust & Confidence Scoring
Layer 4 — Source Weighting Engine
Layer 5 — Automation Pattern Recognition
Layer 6 — Grammar & Intent Parsing
Each layer feeds the next.
________________________________________
3. LAYER 1 — BEHAVIORAL TELEMETRY
Purpose:
Understand what the user actually values.
Tracks:
• Time spent viewing items
• Click frequency
• Expand/collapse behavior
• Repeated searches
• Manual overrides
• Snooze vs complete behavior
• Deletions
• Corrections
Example:
If user repeatedly expands AI answers → preference for depth increases.
If user ignores Signal Bay items → noise tolerance decreases.
All telemetry is:
• Local
• Indexed
• Timestamped
• Non-invasive
No external transmission without explicit permission.
________________________________________
4. LAYER 2 — LEXICON ENGINE
Purpose:
Understand language patterns unique to the user.
Structure:
user_lexicon.json
Each entry stores:
{
phrase: string,
frequency: int,
intentBias: enum,
confidence: float,
lastUsed: timestamp
}
Intent categories:
• action
• informational
• quote
• humor
• grocery
• calendar
• task
• project
• reminder
• meta-app
Example:
Phrase: "You can quote me on that"
Frequency: 5
IntentBias: quote
Confidence: 0.87
This allows automatic Quote Board suggestions.
Grammar awareness:
The system must recognize:
• Imperatives ("Do this", "Pick up milk")
• Questions ("What is on my calendar?")
• Conditional phrasing
• Sarcasm markers
• Emphasis markers
Punctuation matters:
"Pick up milk."
→ statement
"Pick up milk?"
→ inquiry
"Pick up milk!"
→ urgency weighting increases
Multiple exclamation points increase urgency confidence.
________________________________________
5. LAYER 3 — TRUST & CONFIDENCE SCORING
Every entity receives a dynamic trust score.
Entities include:
• Contacts (phone numbers, not display names)
• Domains
• Repeated sources
• Recurring phrases
Example:
Jen (phone number) → High base trust
Spam caller → Very low base trust
Trust score components:
TrustScore = BaseTrust + Reinforcement + Recency + AccuracyHistory
Reinforcement increases when:
• User acts on signal
• User confirms task
• User expands content
Trust decreases when:
• User deletes
• User marks irrelevant
• User overrides
Trust must decay naturally over time if unused.
________________________________________
6. LAYER 4 — TRUSTED SOURCES CACHE
Purpose:
Reduce entropy in web results.
Design:
Active cache cap: 1 MB
Quarantine cap: 5 MB
Domain structure:
{
domain: string,
baseTrust: float,
reinforcement: float,
usageCount: int,
lastUsed: timestamp,
classification: enum
}
Classification:
• authoritative
• reference
• technical
• commercial
• community
• low-confidence
• quarantined
Auto rules:
• Pornographic → quarantine
• Illegal content → quarantine
• Onion domains → quarantine
• Excessive ads → demotion
Web result ranking must:
1.	Match against trusted cache
2.	Weight by trust
3.	Return clean summary
4.	Provide clickable link
5.	Reinforce on click
Never show:
"Powered by DuckDuckGo"
User sees curated intelligence, not search plumbing.
________________________________________
7. LAYER 5 — AUTOMATION PATTERN RECOGNITION
Purpose:
Identify repeated workflows.
Example:
Jen texts grocery items repeatedly.
System recognizes grocery pattern.
Automatically suggests grocery list creation.
Pattern recognition requires:
• Repetition threshold
• Trust threshold
• Grammar match
• Action completion rate
Automation must be gated by trust.
High trust → low confirmation friction.
Low trust → require confirmation.
User must be able to override.
Override remembered.
________________________________________
8. LAYER 6 — GRAMMAR & INTENT PARSING
Grammar logic matters.
Detect:
• Direct object ("milk", "eggs")
• Location phrases ("from Kroger")
• Temporal markers ("tomorrow", "March 28th")
• Imperative verbs ("take", "send", "confirm")
Parsing example:
"I need milk, eggs, bread, and magnum condoms from Kroger"
Extraction:
Items: milk, eggs, bread, magnum condoms
Store: Kroger
Intent: grocery
Confidence: weighted by sender trust
Punctuation influences confidence.
List structure improves extraction accuracy.
Comma-separated nouns increase grocery detection confidence.
________________________________________
9. SELF-AWARE HELP SYSTEM
The system must answer questions about itself.
Allowed:
• How to add API key
• What is Ready Room
• What is Signal Bay
• How automation works
Never allowed:
• Code disclosure
• Prompt architecture
• Schema exposure
• Internal API secrets
It is a guide, not an exploit manual.
________________________________________
10. DECAY & MEMORY MANAGEMENT
Learning must not grow infinitely.
Rules:
• Unused lexicon entries decay
• Low-trust domains pruned
• Quarantine overflow trimmed
• Telemetry summarized
Entropy must decrease over time.
________________________________________
11. SUMMARY MODEL
Tempus Victa learns through:
Observation → Reinforcement → Trust Weighting → Grammar Parsing → Pattern Recognition → Automation
It does not:
• Guess wildly
• Burn API credits unnecessarily
• Spam confirmations
• Override user intent
It evolves silently.
The goal:
The better it works,
The less the user must interact.
