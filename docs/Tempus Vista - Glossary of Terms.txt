Version: 1.0 (Draft)
Status: Active Working Definition
________________________________________
🧭 Core Identity
Tempus Victa
Latin for “Time Conquered.”
The overarching system — a local-first, AI-augmented life operations platform designed to minimize user interaction while maximizing structured execution.
________________________________________
🧠 System Architecture Terms
Local → Web → AI Doctrine
Operational routing order:
1.	Local (free, offline, deterministic)
2.	Web (free, external info)
3.	AI (paid, gated, optional)
AI is never automatic unless explicitly enabled.
________________________________________
Local-First
All core functionality must operate without internet access.
Internet and AI are augmentations, not dependencies.
________________________________________
AI Mode
Explicit, sticky mode that enables AI responses.
Opt-in and opt-out.
Must not revert automatically.
________________________________________
Internet Mode
Default state on load.
Allows web search without invoking AI.
________________________________________
Sticky Mode
Once selected, a mode (Web / Ready Room / AI) remains active until the user manually changes it.
________________________________________
Cap Enforcement
AI usage is limited by monthly token cap to prevent runaway API costs.

🧱 STABILITY FIXES
•	Removed floating bridge crash
•	Null-safe API key handling
•	Prevent async setState after dispose
•	Reduced UI thread blocking
•	Eliminated NavBus dependency


1) Fix navigation: “too many hops” is unacceptable
Hard rule
Ready Room must be 1 tap from anywhere. Bridge must be 1 tap from anywhere.
Implementation (no “web-app” look)
•	Primary nav = Orbital scroller (your “never-ending” rail)
•	Global “Bridge” home icon always visible
•	Ready Room gets a dedicated icon on the rail and also appears in the collapsible sidebar
Settings stays out of primary nav.
________________________________________
2) Daily Brief: auto in the morning + learned timing + one manual button
You want:
•	Auto brief first thing in the morning ✅
•	Learn when you look at it longest ✅
•	Predict best time to show it ✅
•	Manual single button ✅
•	No nagging questions ✅
•	Learn by trial/error (attention + action) ✅
Behavior rules
•	Auto brief at first app open after morning cutoff (default 5:00am)
•	Optional notification (later; Android background service)
•	If you ignore it repeatedly at 7am but open it at 8:30am, it shifts.
•	If you dismiss fast, it learns “bad timing.”
•	If you take action from it, it learns “good timing.”
Manual access
One button, always:
•	On Bridge: “Daily Brief” (single tile)
•	Also in Ready Room left rail: “Daily Brief”
________________________________________
3) How learning works without annoying you
We don’t ask you questions. We log:
Attention signals
•	time on screen
•	scroll depth
•	expand/collapse events
•	which section you dwell on (Today vs Carryover vs Upcoming)
Action signals
•	tapped “Mark done”
•	created task/project from brief
•	opened event details
•	opened link
•	deferred
Scoring
Everything gets two weights:
•	AttentionWeight
•	ActionWeight
Daily Brief timing becomes:
•	a predicted “best window” + fallback window
•	and it adapts by reinforcement (did it lead to engagement + action?)
No “confirmations.” The only explicit prompt is when something is risky (AUTO mode boundaries).
________________________________________
4) What the Daily Brief contains (your spec)
Daily Brief sections:
•	Today: what’s due + scheduled
•	Done today
•	Needs action
•	Added since last brief
•	Carryover from yesterday
•	Upcoming events (lookahead window)
And it must be:
•	short by default
•	expandable for detail
•	auditable timestamps
________________________________________
5) Reality check: “learn even when I’m not using the app”
Two layers:
Layer A (now, works without extra permissions)
Learns when the app is opened / used. Fully local. Offline safe.
Layer B (later, true background learning)
Requires Android permissions/services (notifications/SMS/etc.). We’ll add it later deliberately, gated, with clear audit. No silent creepiness.
________________________________________
Next bundle execution (what I will change in code)
When we do “Engage bundle v2” the code will implement:
1.	Orbital nav as the primary “global” navigation (1 tap everywhere)
2.	Daily Brief engine
o	persistent state
o	timing learner
o	manual button tile
3.	Behavior telemetry (local only)
o	attention + action event logs
4.	Brief renderer
o	short summary + expand
o	no raw JSON
5.	Restore/keep Ready Room UI identity
o	collapsible sidebar stays
o	no pipeline debug cards
















1️⃣ Trusted Sources File
Your 100-domain seed is solid.
It is structured correctly.
It is weighted correctly.
It is balanced correctly.
It is ready to be consumed as:
trusted_sources.json
I will reference it as:
sources_of_truth
We will:
•	Store it locally in /assets/trusted_sources.json
•	Load it on app boot
•	Cache into Drift table
•	Use it as weighting modifier inside web results
•	Not expose it visually
•	Not brand search engine source
Ferrari illusion preserved.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Architecture We Are Implementing (Live)
Pipeline (Final Form)
Local
→ App Knowledge Resolver
→ Trusted Sources Weighted Web Search
→ AI (if enabled OR bypass button)
AI Bypass button:
•	Separate
•	Safe tap spacing
•	Deterministic behavior
Offline:
•	Hard gate web + AI
•	Clear message
•	No fake fallback
________________________________________
3️⃣ Navigation Final Lock
Carousel:
•	Persistent on all screens
•	Includes Bridge as first slot
•	Scrollable infinite feel
•	State preserved
•	Ready Room excluded from carousel
•	Ready Room gets semi-transparent floating Bridge icon
Back button:
•	Pure navigator stack
•	Never forced to Bridge
________________________________________
4️⃣ Ready Room Protocol
Untouched logic.
Improved styling only.
Planned:
• Matrix rain intro
• Black background
• Matrix green text
• Bold colored speaker names (no ** markdown)
• Rain outro
• Returns to normal Ready Room state
Export / Import support:
•	JSON transcript export
•	JSON import for critique
•	Profile reinforcement after each session
Persona reinforcement:
We will introduce:
•	persona reinforcement prompt layer
•	historical trait memory
•	stylistic weighting
•	role divergence enforcement
So it stops feeling like:
“OpenAI in cosplay.”
________________________________________
5️⃣ Signals / Importance Teaching
New system:
Every signal has:
•	trustWeight
•	confidenceWeight
•	importanceOverride (manual)
•	actionOutcome
When you override importance:
•	it updates trust vector
•	updates domain/source weighting
•	updates sender weighting
Learning:
•	Passive reinforcement
•	No interrogation
•	No annoying confirmation loops
________________________________________
6️⃣ Freeze Fix
We will:
•	Remove async writes from UI thread
•	Use mounted checks
•	Isolate bottom sheet lifecycle
•	Prevent state update after dispose
________________________________________
7️⃣ Self-Aware App Layer
We are building:
app_knowledge.json
Contains:
•	What is Ready Room
•	How to enter API key
•	What is Trusted Sources
•	What is Daily Brief
•	How routing works
When user asks:
“How do I add API key?”
Local layer intercepts.
No web.
No AI.
This makes the app feel intelligent without burning tokens.
________________________________________
8️⃣ Daily Brief (Predictive, Not Nagging)
Morning detection model:
•	Time of day
•	Engagement history
•	Average longest interaction window
•	Attention weighting
If not opened:
•	One subtle badge
•	No popups
•	No spam
Manual button always present.
________________________________________
9️⃣ Email Diagnostics Strategy
Phase 0:
•	Local error cache
•	Export diagnostics
Phase 1:
•	Online check-in
•	Email summary
•	OAuth (Google preferred for simplicity)
O365 possible but heavier.
________________________________________
Now I Need One Clarifier Before Code Generation
Do you want:
A) Drift table for Trusted Sources (persistent DB)
B) In-memory cache only (reloaded each boot)
C) Hybrid (load once, store in Drift, allow mutation)
Correct architecture is C.
Reply with single letter.
Then we go live.
Paused.
Sources
C - Important: We don't want to build 500 PB of sources of truth. We need to skim the bottom of the barrel by age and trust level
































🔐 Final Trusted Sources Architecture (Lean + Smart)
We do not store content.
We store:
domain
baseTrust
biasRisk
category
lastUsed
usageCount
reinforcementScore
decayScore
That’s it.
No articles.
No page caching.
No blob storage.
Just weighting metadata.
________________________________________
🧠 Skim The Bottom of the Barrel Rule
We introduce automatic pruning logic:
Decay Logic
If a domain:
•	hasn’t been used in X days
•	AND trust < threshold
•	AND usageCount low
→ reduce reinforcementScore
→ eventually archive or purge
Promotion Logic
If:
•	user clicks repeatedly
•	user takes action after reading
•	user manually increases importance
→ reinforcementScore increases
→ domain trust adjusts upward
________________________________________
🎯 Size Reality
100 domains:
~15–30 KB JSON
Even 10,000 domains:
< 2–3 MB
We are nowhere near storage risk.
The important thing is not size.
It’s entropy control.
So we enforce:
• Hard max domain count (configurable, maybe 2,000)
• Automatic pruning
• No duplicate subdomains unless explicitly allowed
• No article-level storage
________________________________________
🔥 Design Principle (Kirk Mode)
We are not building:
A database of truth.
We are building:
A weighting engine for decision confidence.
Small.
Adaptive.
Relentless.
________________________________________
🧭 Next Move
I will now generate:
1.	Trusted Sources Drift schema
2.	Loader from JSON seed
3.	Reinforcement logic stub
4.	Web result weighting hook
5.	Domain pruning policy
6.	AI Bypass button
7.	Offline hard gate
8.	Bridge click-through fixes
9.	Capture freeze fix
10.	App knowledge local resolver
Full file replaces.
No half measures.
Say:
“Execute.”
And I’ll go live.
sources_of_truth.json
File
I'm generated a 1,000 sources file (ingest attachment). We can automatically delete anything that is porn or illegal content. We're a moral app, but Jesus isn't our CEO too. These sources are NOT completely inclusive. They're simply jumping off pages to save endless searching loops
Ingested. 
engineering_handoff
Good move scaling to 1,000.
You’re thinking correctly:
These are not “truth.”
They are high-probability entry points to reduce search entropy.
That’s the right mental model.
________________________________________
✅ Policy Decision: Porn / Illegal Content Filtering
We will NOT manually curate 1,000 domains by hand.
We will implement automated domain sanitation layer:
1️⃣ Hard Filter (Immediate Exclusion)
Delete domains if they match:
•	Known porn domain lists (pattern-based)
•	Explicit keyword match in domain (porn, xxx, sexvideo, etc.)
•	Known illegal content distribution domains
•	Dark web domains (.onion)
2️⃣ Soft Filter (Low Trust Demotion)
Domains with:
•	heavy political activism
•	propaganda characteristics
•	excessive ads / affiliate traps
These don’t get deleted.
They get demoted.
________________________________________
🔐 Moral Framework (You’re Right)
We are not a theocracy.
We are not a censorship engine.
We are:
A weighting and entropy reduction engine.
So we:
•	Remove clearly illegal / exploitative content
•	Demote low-signal garbage
•	Preserve intellectual diversity
•	Avoid ideological filtering
Clean. Neutral. Useful.
________________________________________
⚙️ How 1,000 Domains Will Behave
We will NOT load all 1,000 into memory every search.
We will:
• Load once into Drift
• Maintain in table
• Query by domain match only
• Weight on demand
No scanning full list each query.
Efficient.
________________________________________
🔥 Next Engineering Moves
Now that 1,000 exists:
1.	JSON → Drift ingestion
2.	Sanitation pass (automatic)
3.	Cap active domain count (e.g., 2,000 max)
4.	Reinforcement scoring
5.	Prune stale low-value domains
6.	Hook weighting into web results
No UI exposure.
Silent system.
________________________________________
One Important Question Before Implementation
Do you want:
A) Hard delete filtered domains permanently
B) Move filtered domains to quarantined table (recoverable)
Best architecture is B.
Reply with single letter.
Paused.
Sources
B This file is really small. Let's set a cap size to 1 MB for active and 5 MB for quarantine (unless you think different sizes are better - don't confirm, just choose) Proceed!
Locked.
Active cap: 1 MB
Quarantine cap: 5 MB
That ratio is correct.
Active remains tight and high-signal.
Quarantine allows historical audit + future reconsideration.
No confirmation loop. Moving forward.
________________________________________
🧠 What Happens Now (Implementation Blueprint)
1️⃣ Ingestion Layer
On first boot or version mismatch:
•	Load sources_of_truth.json
•	Sanitize domains
•	Normalize (lowercase, strip www)
•	Deduplicate
•	Insert into Drift table
Tables:
trusted_sources_active
•	domain TEXT PRIMARY KEY
•	baseTrust REAL
•	biasRisk REAL
•	category TEXT
•	reinforcement REAL
•	usageCount INTEGER
•	lastUsed INTEGER (epoch)
•	insertedAt INTEGER
•	decay REAL
trusted_sources_quarantine
•	domain TEXT PRIMARY KEY
•	reason TEXT
•	originalTrust REAL
•	insertedAt INTEGER
________________________________________
2️⃣ Sanitation Rules
Hard quarantine if:
•	Explicit keywords in domain
•	Known adult network domains
•	Known piracy patterns
•	.onion
•	domain length anomalies + suspicious TLD cluster
Soft demotion if:
•	Ad-heavy news clones
•	Activist propaganda
•	Low historical trust
________________________________________
3️⃣ Cap Enforcement
After ingestion:
Active size > 1 MB?
→ Sort by:
reinforcement DESC
baseTrust DESC
usageCount DESC
→ Keep top N until under 1 MB
Overflow moves to quarantine.
Quarantine > 5 MB?
→ Oldest removed permanently.
No uncontrolled growth.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Web Weighting Hook
When web results return:
For each result:
weight =
(baseTrust * 0.6) +
(reinforcement * 0.3) +
(recencyBoost * 0.1)
Then sort descending.
User never sees this math.
They just see:
•	Better ranked answers
•	Cleaner summaries
•	High-confidence sources first
________________________________________
5️⃣ Reinforcement Engine
When user:
•	Clicks a source → reinforcement++
•	Completes task after reading → reinforcement++
•	Manually increases importance → reinforcement += larger delta
•	Ignores repeatedly → decay++
Scheduled nightly:
•	reinforcement -= small decay
•	drop if trust low + usage zero
Self-cleaning system.
________________________________________
6️⃣ Offline Behavior
Offline:
•	Local + Trusted Sources weighting only
•	No web
•	No AI
•	Clear system message
________________________________________
7️⃣ Ready Room AI Bypass
Separate AI button.
Spaced.
48dp tap target.
Distinct color.
No collision risk.
________________________________________
8️⃣ Capture Freeze Fix
Move DB writes into:
Future.microtask()
Guard:
if (!mounted) return;
Prevent double Navigator pops.
UI will not hang.
________________________________________
9️⃣ Bridge Metrics Clickable
Signals (Inbox) → opens filtered Signals
Actions (Open) → opens Actions screen
No dead tiles.
________________________________________
⚡ Execution Phase
Next response will contain:
•	Drift schema FULL file
•	Ingestion service FULL file
•	Sanitation utility FULL file
•	Cap enforcement utility FULL file
•	Web weighting integration
•	Ready Room AI Bypass UI update
•	Capture freeze patch
All full replacements.
No fragments.
No drift.
No half measures.
We are building the entropy reduction engine now.
Proceeding.
Sounds awesome! Proceed if you haven't already done so
Perfect.
Here’s the reality check before I dump 1,500+ lines of full file replacements on you:
We have crossed from “feature tweaks” into core data layer restructuring.
If I proceed right now without first seeing:
•	your current app_database.dart
•	your current web_search_*
•	your current ready_room_screen.dart
•	your current capture → action flow
•	your current provider structure
…there is a high probability of:
•	schema collision
•	drift migration failure
•	provider mismatch
•	frozen UI again
•	duplicate navigation shells
•	broken Ready Room
You explicitly said:
“No code surgery.”
If I blast in full replacements blind, that’s code surgery.
________________________________________
Strategic Move (Kirk Mode Decision)
Before we execute the full Trusted Sources engine + nav shell refactor + AI bypass + freeze fix:
I need your current:
1.	app_database.dart
2.	ready_room_screen.dart
3.	web_search_duckduckgo.dart
4.	actions_repo.dart
5.	home_screen.dart (latest working one)
6.	main.dart
Upload those.
Then I:
•	Merge cleanly
•	Preserve your existing schema
•	Avoid destructive migration
•	Avoid losing data
•	Avoid freeze loops
________________________________________
Why I’m Pausing
Because the next move is a structural layer upgrade, not a UI tweak.
We are about to:
•	Add new Drift tables
•	Add JSON ingestion on boot
•	Add sanitation and cap enforcement
•	Modify pipeline order
•	Modify Ready Room input handling
•	Modify nav shell
•	Add AI bypass logic
•	Fix async UI bug
That is a coordinated change set.
We do it once.
We do it clean.
We do not brick your install.
________________________________________
Upload the six files.
Then we go live properly.
Standing by.
OK. We'll do it however you think is best. Just go!
I love the energy.
But here’s the hard truth:
If I “just go” right now, blind, we risk:
•	Drift schema mismatch → migration crash
•	Ready Room override → broken protocol
•	Provider wiring mismatch → black screens
•	Another freeze on UI thread
•	Navigation stack corruption
•	Data loss
You already hit freezes and missing members once. That was minor.
This next change is structural.
And structural changes without seeing your current DB + providers = roulette.
You told me:
No code surgery.
So we don’t perform surgery without imaging.
________________________________________
What I Need (Non-Negotiable for Clean Execution)
Upload these exact files from your current working build:
1.	lib/data/app_database.dart
2.	lib/features/ready_room/ready_room_screen.dart
3.	lib/data/repos/actions_repo.dart
4.	lib/features/home/home_screen.dart
5.	lib/services/web_search_duckduckgo.dart
6.	lib/main.dart
That’s it.
No guessing.
No partial rewrites.
No broken migrations.
________________________________________
Why This Matters
We are about to:
•	Add two new Drift tables
•	Add ingestion-on-boot logic
•	Add sanitation + cap enforcement
•	Modify pipeline order
•	Inject AI bypass
•	Modify nav shell
•	Fix async freeze
•	Add app_knowledge resolver
That touches:
•	DB schema
•	Boot sequence
•	Ready Room logic
•	Navigation shell
•	Async lifecycle
If I don’t see your current state, I can’t safely merge.
________________________________________
This Is the Right Move
You’re building a real system now.
Not a demo.
